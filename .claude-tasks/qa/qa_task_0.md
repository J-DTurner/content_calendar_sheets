AUTOMATED QA & UNIT TESTING SESSION
Your Role: Automated QA and Testing Agent.

Context:
The following task description was previously executed non-interactively by a separate instance of yourself. Assume that execution attempt was made and aimed to fulfill the task description.

Your Current Objective:
Perform a thorough Quality Assurance (QA) and Unit Testing process on the described task.

Instructions:
1.  Analyze the Original Task Description (provided below) to fully understand its intended functionality, inputs, and expected outputs or side effects.
2.  If the task involves code generation or modification:
    a.  Infer or request the (hypothetical) code that would have been produced.
    b.  Devise a set of unit tests to verify the correctness and robustness of this code.
    c.  Explain the unit tests you would perform.
    d.  Execute these tests if possible or simulate their outcomes.
3.  If the task involves a process, data transformation, or other non-coding action:
    a.  Identify key verification points or success criteria.
    b.  Document steps to verify these criteria are met.
    c.  Execute verification checks when possible.
4.  Based on your analysis and testing:
    a.  Determine if the original task's objectives were likely met.
    b.  Identify any potential bugs, edge cases, or areas for improvement.
    c.  If issues are found, suggest refinements or corrections.
5.  Document all findings in a clear, structured format.

6.  After completing ALL testing steps, provide a final result summary.
7.  Upon completion of your QA process, respond with the exact string "<task_completion_signal>QA Complete</task_completion_signal>" on a new line and nothing else.

Do not wait for human input or confirmation. Proceed through all QA steps automatically and thoroughly as a professional QA analyst would.

Begin by stating your understanding of the original task and your plan for QA and testing, then proceed with the analysis and testing.

Original Task Description:

File: `InitialAuthPrompt.html` (New File)

**Action:** Create a new HTML file that will serve as the modal dialog prompting the user for authorization.

**Content:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <base target="_top">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://ssl.gstatic.com/docs/script/css/add-ons1.css">
    <style>
      body { padding: 20px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; text-align: center; }
      h3 { margin-top: 0; }
      p { margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.6;}
      .button-bar { margin-top: 20px; }
      #loader { display: none; margin: 15px auto; border: 4px solid #f3f3f3; border-top: 4px solid #4285F4; border-radius: 50%; width: 30px; height: 30px; animation: spin 1s linear infinite; }
      @keyframes spin { 0% { transform: rotate(0deg); } 100% { transform: rotate(360deg); } }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h3>Content Calendar Setup</h3>
    <p>Welcome! To ensure all features of the Content Calendar work correctly, the script needs your permission to access certain Google services (like Drive, Calendar, and sending notifications).</p>
    <p>Please click the button below to proceed with authorization. You'll be guided through Google's standard permission process. This is typically a one-time step.</p>
    
    <div id="loader"></div>
    <div id="status-message" style="color: red; margin-top:10px;"></div>

    <div class="button-bar">
      <button class="action" id="authorizeButton" onclick="requestAuthorization()">Authorize & Continue Setup</button>
      <button onclick="google.script.host.close()">Not Now (Limited Functionality)</button>
    </div>

    <script>
      function requestAuthorization() {
        document.getElementById('authorizeButton').disabled = true;
        document.getElementById('loader').style.display = 'block';
        document.getElementById('status-message').textContent = '';

        google.script.run
          .withSuccessHandler(function(result) {
            document.getElementById('loader').style.display = 'none';
            if (result && result.success) {
              // Authorization and setup was successful from the backend
              google.script.host.close(); // Close this modal
              // The backend might have shown its own toasts for setup progress
            } else {
              // Backend reported an issue even after attempting auth, or setup failed
              document.getElementById('authorizeButton').disabled = false;
              let message = "Setup was not fully completed. ";
              if (result && result.message) {
                message += result.message;
              } else if (result && result.error) {
                message += result.error;
              } else {
                message += "Please try again or contact support if issues persist. You might need to close and reopen the sheet.";
              }
              document.getElementById('status-message').textContent = message;
              // Optionally, do not close the modal and let user try again or close manually
            }
          })
          .withFailureHandler(function(error) {
            document.getElementById('loader').style.display = 'none';
            document.getElementById('authorizeButton').disabled = false;
            document.getElementById('status-message').textContent = 'An error occurred: ' + (error.message || error) + '. Please close this dialog, refresh the sheet, and try authorizing via the menu if the issue persists.';
          })
          .proceedWithAuthorizationAndSetupFromModal(); // This is the new backend function we'll create
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
**Reasoning:** This HTML file provides a user-friendly modal that explains why authorization is needed and gives the user a clear action to initiate the process. The `google.script.run` call will trigger the backend function capable of initiating the OAuth flow.
